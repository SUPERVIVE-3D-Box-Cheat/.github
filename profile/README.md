## 📦 What Is the 3D Box Cheat?

The 3D Box Cheat is an **ESP-based visual hack** that overlays clean, cornered boxes around every player in real time. These aren’t just visual gimmicks—they give you tactical clarity on position, movement, and range. Each box is **tied to enemy hitboxes**, tracking where they go, even behind walls, doors, or cover.

And yes, you can **customize color, box size, visibility checks**, and even add **health bars or nameplates** for full situational awareness.
